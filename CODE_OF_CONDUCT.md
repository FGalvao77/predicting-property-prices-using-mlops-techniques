# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, offensive comments, or derogatory language
- Personal attacks or sustained disruption of discussions

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying expected behavior and enforcing the Code of Conduct. Reports of unacceptable behavior should be sent to the project maintainer(s).

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue with the label `private` or by emailing the project owner.
